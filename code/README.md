# Continuous Rater Experiment

## Overview

In this directory you can find the following:
- ```code```: contains a notebook for creating parameter files used in a continuous-rater experiment
- ```experiments```: HTML/Javascript code for running a continuous rater experiment
- ```presentation-orders```: information about presentation order for each participant
- ```rating-orders```: information about rating type on each trial for each participant
- ```ratings```: information about rating type/scale used in the experiment
- ```stimuli```: example set of stimuli to source for experiment development


### Experiment Design
- Pink noise: enjoyment, flow, interactivity
- Negation: feeling of understanding the otherâ€™s mind, or vice versa



### Welcome page
[X] 

### Pink Noise (continuous-rater) instructions
[X] add shared instructions
    - you'll be listening to conversation all the way through and provide a continuous rating of how much you enjoyed the conversation
    - definition page (similar to reminders): most enjoyable moment to least
    - last page of instructions is the same as tommy's w/an image of the arrow keys

### Practice with arrow keys
[X] same as with tommy's (arrow key all the way up, great job, all the way down.)
[X] no multiple choice quiz

### Negation instructions
[X] at various intervals, you'll be interrupted and asked how well you were understood by your partner and how well your partner was understood by you

### Practice trial
# participants will then practice loop on a common stimulus used as a way to standardize ratings
[X] accepts multiple audio clips
[X] make practice stim with katie
[X] practice-pinknoise-plugin
[X] practice-negation-plugin
[X] practice plugins only slightly different from actual experiment (actual experiment has wording specific to participant, practice is general)

### Trial Loop Structure
# for each trial, participants will continuously rate audio clips (negation) and then rate pink noise (understand/understood) using the audio-rating-plugin
[X] pinknoise-rating-plugin
    - while audio plays
    - continuous-rater rating box (scale = most enjoyment - least enjoyment)
        - modify so it shows the last 15s of ratings (even on next trial (so on first clip, the bar will be flat line, next trial the participant will see same history as end of previous trial))
[X] negation-rating-plugin
    - after audio plays
        - side-by-side: 'you understood partner with likert beneath' next to 'partner understood you' with 0-10 likert beneath
        - must provide answer to both
[X] repeats pinknoise-rating and negation-rating for each clip until end of convo



### audio-splitter code
- waiting on katie to send me an example .wav file
- how audio will be split is still up in the air


####
- attention check if the pinknoise-rating indicator has not been updated in one minute (appears after negation rating)
- add practice stim to timeline (should be split into 15 s chunks)
- preload stim?
- instructions/text to Katie's satisfaction
- double check audio is spliting appropriately
- data saving?
- clean up code!
- bug hunt
